We can affirm our faith without endangering the separation of church and state, as long as we understand that when we're in the public square, we have to speak in universal terms that everyone can understand. The fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger in some of Reverend Wright's sermons simply reminds us of the old truism that the most segregated hour in American life occurs on Sunday morning. Kennedy called our \"intellectual and moral strength.\" Yes, the government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. But we should choose the right path, not just the easy path.\n\n<br>\n\nbold **text**\n\n<br>\n\n\nOur problems must be dealt with through partnership; progress must be shared. And yet Al Qaeda chose to ruthlessly murder these people, claimed credit for the attack, and even now states their determination to kill on a massive scale.\n\n\n<br>\n\nAnd it's around this time that some pastors I was working with came up to me and asked if I was a member of a church. And we cannot ignore the very real concerns of Americans who are not worried about illegal immigration because they are racist or xenophobic, but because they fear it will result in lower wages when they're already struggling to raise their families. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. And I've seen it in this campaign. The enduring faith of over a billion people is so much bigger than the narrow hatred of a few.\n\n\n<br>\n\nThank you.",

And if we can do that - if we can embrace a common destiny - then I believe we'll not just help bring about a more hopeful day in America, we'll not just be caring for our own souls, we'll be doing God's work here on Earth. They had to file for bankruptcy, and that's when Ashley decided that she had to do something to help her mom. When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty. Just as Muslims do not fit a crude stereotype, America is not the crude stereotype of a self-interested empire.\n\nYou know, a while back, I met a young man named Shamus [Seamus?] in a V.F.W. Iraq's sovereignty is its own. But this much is clear: governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable, successful and secure.\n\nAmerica, now is not the time for small plans. government has gone to court to protect the right of women and girls to wear the hijab, and to punish those who would deny it. When violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains, people are endangered across an ocean. It is easy to point fingers - for Palestinians to point to the displacement brought by Israel's founding, and for Israelis to point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history from within its borders as well as beyond. This truth transcends nations and peoples - a belief that isn't new; that isn't black or white or brown; that isn't Christian, or Muslim or Jew.\n\nThank you, and God bless America.",

But let us be clear: al Qaeda killed nearly 3,000 people on that day.\n\nBut the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time. It is time for these settlements to stop.\n\nAnd when the Civil War was fought and our country dedicated itself to a new birth of freedom, they took on the problems of an industrializing nation - fighting the crimes against society and the sins against God that they felt were being committed in our factories and in our slums. You make a big election about small things. This last point is important because there are some who advocate for democracy only when they are out of power; once in power, they are ruthless in suppressing the rights of others. In all nations - including my own - this change can bring fear.\n\nThank you. And may God's peace be upon you.",

      "body": "But if we do, I can tell you that in the next election, we'll be talking about some other distraction. We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work. But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy. The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past. And I've seen it in this campaign. That's why we're partnering with a coalition of forty-six countries.\n\nYou don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq. We will, however, relentlessly confront violent extremists who pose a grave threat to our security.\n\nAnd they want that choice. I learned that everyone's got a sacred story when you take the time to listen. For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time. The richness of religious diversity must be upheld - whether it is for Maronites in Lebanon or the Copts in Egypt.\n\nGod bless you.",

Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. That is the world we seek.\n\nBut my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. For some, nagging questions remain. But race is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now. I do so recognizing that change cannot happen overnight. Israel must also live up to its obligations to ensure that Palestinians can live, and work, and develop their society.\n\nThey stood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, as the blows of billy clubs rained down. We can pounce on some gaffe by a Hillary supporter as evidence that she's playing the race card, or we can speculate on whether white men will all flock to John McCain in the general election regardless of his policies. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. I am a Christian, but my father came from a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims. The second major source of tension that we need to discuss is the situation between Israelis, Palestinians and the Arab world. The question, now, is not what Iran is against, but rather what future it wants to build.\n\nThank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.",

This time we want to talk about how the lines in the Emergency Room are filled with whites and blacks and Hispanics who do not have health care; who don't have the power on their own to overcome the special interests in Washington, but who can take them on if we do it together. To play a role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations, and to unify the Palestinian people, Hamas must put an end to violence, recognize past agreements, and recognize Israel's right to exist. That is the spirit we need today.\n\nWhen John McCain said we could just \"muddle through\" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words - within our borders, and around the world. We will help Iraq train its Security Forces and develop its economy.\n\nI didn't fall out in church, as folks sometimes do. It comes from Deuteronomy 30 when Moses talks to his followers about the challenges they'll find when they reach the Promised Land without him. They had to file for bankruptcy, and that's when Ashley decided that she had to do something to help her mom. Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours - Hillary Rodham Clinton. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives. Instead, they overlap, and share common principles - principles of justice and progress; tolerance and the dignity of all human beings.\n\nThank you, and God bless America.",
